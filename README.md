[Correct C++](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp) chapter 'Hello'.

## Goal

 * Understand [how this course works](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/how_this_course_works.md)

## Prerequisites

 * None

## Exercise

Write any program that is correct. 

Feel free to just copy-paste this code to `main.cpp`:

```c++
int main() {}
```

This is [how this course works](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/how_this_course_works.md):

 * You will need to fork this repository. See [fork a chapter](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/fork_a_chapter.md) for help
 * After this, you will need to clone that fork. See [clone your fork](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/clone_your_fork.md) for help
 * On the local code, modify `main.cpp` to a compiling program. See [do the exercise](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/do_the_exercise.md) for help
 * Done with the exercise? Push your code! See [Push your code](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/push_your_code.md) for help
 * Is your solution pushed to your GitHub? Let Travis [correct your code](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/correct_your_code.md)

Your code must be correct, thus your code must:

 * compile cleanly at high warning levels [1,2] 
 * have [a low cyclomatic complexity](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/lower_cyclomatic_complexity.md):
 * have [how a 100% code coverage](https://github.com/martje127/correct_cpp/blob/master/get_100_percent_code_coverage.md):
